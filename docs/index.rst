Salmon - A Python SMTPd
=======================

Salmon is a pure Python SMTP server designed to create robust and complex mail
applications in the style of modern web frameworks. Unlike traditional SMTP
servers such as Postfix and Sendmail, Salmon has all the features of a web
application stack (templates, routing, handlers, state machine, Python) without
the need to configure alias files, arcane command syntax, or juggle a swarm of
fragile processes. Salmon also plays well with other frameworks and libraries,
such as Django and SQLAlchemy.

Salmon has been released uner the GNU GPLv3, as published by the FSF.
